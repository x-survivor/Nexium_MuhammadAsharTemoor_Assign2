## üìå After-Deadline Update (Submitted: July 15, 11:59 PM)

> ‚è±Ô∏è These updates were made after the official deadline to resolve critical deployment issues and improve stability. All core features were implemented and submitted on time.

### ‚úÖ 1. MongoDB Connection Error on Vercel

- **Problem:** MongoDB connection was failing on Vercel with the error:
- **Reason:** MongoDB Atlas was **blocking incoming connections** from Vercel because only public IP address of my computer had been whitelisted.
- **Fix:** Added `0.0.0.0/0` to the **Network Access IP whitelist** in MongoDB Atlas. This allowed external services (like Vercel) to connect successfully.

### ‚úÖ 2. API Route Crashed on Vercel Deployment

- **Problem:** The API route that connects to MongoDB was crashing on Vercel with runtime errors.
- **Reason:** Vercel's **Edge Runtime** (default for API routes in `app/`) does **not support MongoDB Node.js driver**.
- **Fix:** Explicitly added this line at the top of the API file to force Node.js runtime:
```ts
export const runtime = "nodejs";
